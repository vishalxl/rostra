# ARCH-client-runtime: Identity client orchestration

`rostra-client` is the runtime boundary for one Rostra identity. It composes
the per-identity database, Pkarr identity discovery, an iroh endpoint, typed
Rostra RPC connections, publication APIs, and synchronization tasks. Its place
in the wider system is described by
[ARCH-rostra](../../../specs/ARCH-rostra.md).

## Modes and authority

A client always has a Rostra identity and a database interface. Supplying
durable storage creates a full client; otherwise the client uses temporary
in-memory storage. Full clients run background replication and projection
maintenance tasks. Both modes can serve incoming requests when configured to
start the request handler.

A client begins read-only unless given or later unlocked with the secret key
matching its identity. Unlocking starts tasks that require signing authority,
including identity-state publication and merging local graph heads.
Read-only operation can resolve peers, receive requests, synchronize known
data, and expose stored state without possessing the identity secret.

## Network composition

Pkarr maps a Rostra identity to its advertised iroh endpoint and a deterministic
representative of its current graph-head set. The representative does not imply
that the set is a singleton. Iroh supplies encrypted peer transport under the
Rostra v0 ALPN.
`rostra-p2p` provides typed RPC connections; the client decides whom to
connect to, caches connections, tracks per-identity and per-node backoff, and
passes verified data to
[ARCH-client-database](../../rostra-client-db/specs/ARCH-client-database.md).
Unsigned routing and admission metadata in a response remains peer-controlled.
When `WAIT_FOLLOWERS_NEW_HEADS` supplies both a claimed author and a signed
event, the client requires the claim to equal the event's cryptographically
verified author before applying Web-of-Trust admission or storing the event.

Relay-only iroh transport is the default privacy mode. Explicit public mode
enables direct IP transports. Published endpoint data is sanitized to avoid
advertising local, loopback, documentation, multicast, and similar unsuitable
addresses.

## Runtime tasks and flows

The request handler serves graph heads, event envelopes, and content to peers.
For a durable client, cooperating tasks react to database notifications and
periodic discovery to:

- discover newer heads for followers and followees;
- fetch absent event parents and payloads;
- synchronize the direct and extended web of trust;
- broadcast local head changes and update derived news scores.

The tasks coordinate through durable database state and subscriptions rather
than owning a second graph state. They must tolerate duplicate wakeups,
temporary peer failure, and out-of-order delivery. Dropping the client requests
cancellation of its background work. Internal multi-client ownership retains
shared join completion so DB-only reconstruction waits until every old task has
actually terminated. Completion is retained before construction starts any task;
a unique abort-on-drop owner moves from partial construction into the client.
Failed or panicked initialization therefore follows the same join-before-retry
rule, including workers that hold no database reference.

Retained current-state subscriptions expose owned snapshots of the self head,
followees, followers, and Web of Trust. Runtime tasks may keep those snapshots
across network waits or database operations without retaining a Tokio watch
borrow that can block post-commit publication. Lossy broadcasts and
deduplicating work signals retain their incremental semantics.

Verified-data ingestion uses the database's fallible processing boundary.
Invariant, transaction, and storage failures are local database failures, not
peer-availability failures: request and publication paths return them to their
caller, while a background ingestion loop logs the affected identity or event
and stops its affected task or worker. Such failures do not enter peer backoff
or missing-content retry state. The runtime does not globally restart stopped
tasks; reopening or otherwise recovering the client remains an operational
decision.

Temporary payload-capacity pauses are not such failures. Acquisition retains
Missing work, avoids peer backoff, and schedules a bounded later retry so a paused
queue-front event cannot starve other authors. The connection cache owns shared-store
reuse and per-attempt buffer admission; transport APIs retain caller-owned guards
without depending on the database crate. Local publication returns a clear storage
capacity error, while pushed payloads can receive the existing refusal response
before sending bytes. Production admission remains disabled without a setter;
caller integration alone does not authorize runtime pruning.

Multi-client hosting can install immutable, explicitly listed account acquisition
ledgers before exposing HTTP or loading a database. The same ledger follows a
verified request into lazy loading, and only one database may attach it at a time.
Manager clones serialize lazy open/build/publication to prevent duplicate opens.
LRU removal retains discoverability of request/task-owned clients and databases:
reload reuses surviving ownership rather than reopening live storage. Retired
database keepers close under the load lock only after atomic sole-ownership
acquisition; a bounded weak-manager reaper releases them after external owners
finish and old tasks terminate. The public builder still consumes its database;
shared-database reconstruction is private to the crate. The cache count therefore
does not bound all live resources. Cold
initialization completes independently of request cancellation so open storage
cannot become undiscoverable before publication.
Unverified unlisted identities do not create registry entries or databases.
Account ownership is implemented, but every constructible account is still
disabled: runtime mode/budget/policy configuration and enforcement remain absent.
There is no live reconfiguration API; startup configuration changes require fresh
construction after old client work and guards have quiesced.

Head handling depends on the operation. Local publication and retained state
use the minimum event ID as a deterministic representative. Incremental
broadcasts carry the exact newly accepted head. The broadcaster initially
reconciles the complete durable set, retains current header-first heads until
their content becomes available, and reconciles again after signal lag or
follower-set changes. A newer current descendant subsumes a pending historical
ancestor. Heads in the `Missing` lifecycle state wait for content; explicit
terminal states are discarded. The broadcaster loads at most one ready payload
at a time. Repeated `GET_HEAD` requests independently and uniformly sample the
current set so persistent siblings remain discoverable without changing the v0
wire shape. Paths that require every branch iterate the complete durable set
rather than treating a sample as complete.

`WAIT_HEAD_UPDATE` retains its compatible single-head cursor: it waits while
the caller-provided head remains in the server's current set. It therefore
cannot reveal an already-existing sibling while that known head stays current;
complete immediate fork discovery would require a future bounded full-set or
set-difference RPC. The signing-only head merger scans durable heads immediately
when it starts or the identity is unlocked, then reacts to later changes and
stitches pairs until fewer than two remain.

Head synchronization discovers the graph backward: it must fetch a newer
event's envelope before it can learn that event's parents. It then defers that
event's payload, traverses backward toward older ancestors, and prioritizes
queued payloads by effective timestamp, with deeper ancestors first when
timestamps tie. This older-first, depth-biased traversal deliberately makes
payload processing order opportunistically approximate author production order.
Envelope insertion still proceeds from each discovered child toward its parents,
and sibling-envelope discovery is ordered by event ID rather than strict
depth-first search. Missing data, concurrent branches, peer availability, retries,
and previously stored events can change the observed processing order, so this
is neither a canonical ordering nor a convergence guarantee. Reception order
remains database-local as specified by
[ARCH-client-database](../../rostra-client-db/specs/ARCH-client-database.md).

Publication constructs content events through `rostra-core`, selects the
deterministic representative as its default previous parent, signs with the
unlocked identity key, and stores through the
same database processing path used for received data. This keeps local and
remote validation and projections aligned with
[SPEC-event-graph](../../rostra-core/specs/SPEC-event-graph.md).
