# SPEC-event-content-lifecycle: Event content processing

## Record justification

The lifecycle spans event and content tables, reference counting, fetch
scheduling, ingestion transactions, projection processing and reversion, and
client retrieval. Local documentation beside any one component cannot describe
the complete state machine and its cross-table invariants.

Event envelopes and payload bytes have independent arrival and retention
lifecycles. The database preserves the event graph while fetching, processing,
deduplicating, pruning, or deleting payloads. This behavior implements
[SPEC-event-graph](../../rostra-core/specs/SPEC-event-graph.md) within
[ARCH-client-database](ARCH-client-database.md).

The public high-level content-ingestion boundary accepts either arrival order.
`VerifiedEventContent` carries its verified envelope, so content ingestion first
inserts that envelope when it is absent and then applies the ordinary content
lifecycle in the same transaction. Supplying the envelope separately before or
afterward is idempotent. Existing-envelope-only transaction helpers are internal
implementation and migration interfaces, not caller preconditions.

Total replay has one additional phase constraint: it streams all retained
envelopes before streaming available payloads. Complete envelope state therefore
decides deletion and pruning eligibility before any content projection is
rebuilt. Event order within either pass does not affect semantic state, and
replay does not retain or topologically sort the event graph in memory.

## States

Every inserted event has one effective content state:

- **Missing** means payload processing is still required and includes fetch
  attempt scheduling.
- **Processed** is represented by no content-state entry and means all
  content-derived side effects were applied.
- **Invalid** means payload validation or kind-specific processing failed.
- **Deleted** records an author's graph-level deletion instruction.
- **Pruned** records a local decision not to retain or process the payload.

Deleted is UX best-effort metadata, not proof of erasure. A compliant replica
uses the signed instruction to hide the payload, revert applicable social-post
projections, and make locally stored bytes eligible for garbage collection when
no references remain. It cannot compel another replica, including a malicious
operator, to discard bytes already replicated. Local garbage-collection
eligibility also does not mean immediate removal or secure erasure.

Unless it starts in Deleted, an event with empty content is processed at
insertion and does not enter Missing. The local maximum payload length is an
exclusive upper bound: non-Deleted payloads below the maximum are eligible for
processing, while those at or above it are pruned. An already-Deleted payload
remains Deleted and is ineligible regardless of size. A deletion instruction can
arrive before the target event; when the target later arrives it starts in
Deleted without becoming Missing or contributing a content reference.

## Processing and idempotency

Envelope insertion is idempotent. On first insertion, content that is neither
deleted nor pruned contributes one reference to its content hash. If usable
bytes are not already present, the event enters Missing and is scheduled for
retrieval. If matching bytes are present, content processing may proceed
without another network fetch.

Only Missing content is eligible for first-time processing. Successful
processing validates the payload, applies kind-specific projections, stores
the bytes by content hash, removes fetch scheduling, and transitions to
Processed. The sole terminal-state exception is immutable replacement-lineage
extraction from a verified, well-formed Deleted `SOCIAL_POST` payload, as
defined below. Repeated delivery of an envelope or payload must not duplicate
reference counts, reply counts, follow changes, or other projections.
Eligibility is established before fetch scheduling is removed, so rejected or
terminal-state payload delivery cannot orphan a Missing event.

Successful ordinary SocialPost projection also appends one occurrence to the
database-local materialization feed in the ingestion transaction. This includes
top-level posts, replies, reactions, news posts, and applicable nonblank edits.
Header-only or still-Missing content, malformed content, pruned oversized
content, blank deletion posts, already-Deleted lineage-only processing, and
duplicates append nothing. A late payload appends when it materializes rather
than at envelope receipt time.

Projections that retain one latest source event use the maximum
`(event.timestamp, ShortEventId)` defined by
[SPEC-event-graph](../../rostra-core/specs/SPEC-event-graph.md). Follow and
unfollow, profile, generic singleton, and individual-vote reducers all use this
order. A vote changes its aggregate only when it wins that same comparison, so
the aggregate and retained vote cannot select different equal-second events.
Each individual-vote winner retains its authoritative current-projection full
target and closed vote value beside the source event ID. A newer winner changes
the aggregate by the difference between its value and the retained old value,
then updates the aggregate and winner in one transaction. If different full
targets have the same shortened event ID used by the singleton auxiliary key,
replacement subtracts the old contribution from its full target and adds the
new contribution to its full target in that transaction. A query returns the
cached value only when the requested full target matches. Reading or replacing
a vote does not resolve the old source event or payload. Missing source bytes
after delete, prune, or garbage collection are therefore valid and do not make
the projection unavailable.
Only a `SOCIAL_VOTE` whose header is singleton-shaped and whose auxiliary key
matches its payload target enters this coupled winner/aggregate projection; a
mismatched shape cannot block a valid vote. A retained cached target must keep
the same shortened event ID as its singleton row key; a missing projection or
key mismatch is corruption and fails reads and replacement without mutation.
Retained signed events and payloads remain the authority for total replay and
explicit integrity audits. An audit that detects disagreement with an inline
value must quarantine or recompute the affected projection; it must not patch
only the winner cache and leave the aggregate unchanged.
Normal total replay trusts the authentication already performed at ingestion
and is not such an audit. It still decodes retained records and checks payload
length and hash when constructing verified content.

Invalid content is not stored and transitions to Invalid. Deletion, pruning,
or invalidation removes the event's reference to the content hash exactly
once. A later transition from Invalid or Pruned to Deleted records the
author's stronger deletion intent without decrementing again. When deletion
invalidates an already processed social post, the database reverts its
post-specific projections. The effective-reception forward row and its exact
event-to-key reverse row are removed atomically; the durable database-local
reception allocator is not rewound or reused. An absent reverse key is a no-op
when deletion ordering prevented the ordinary projection from being
materialized. A mapped key that names another event, or a mapped key with no
forward row, is corruption and aborts the deletion transaction.
Derived projections for other content kinds are currently retained.

Reverting, pruning, replacing, or deleting a logged SocialPost never removes its
materialization occurrence. Scans resolve the immutable event identity against
one current-state snapshot and report it as removed when ordinary content is no
longer readable. Replay suppresses occurrence emission because it reconstructs
state rather than observing a new materialization.

Ordinary social-post projection insertion and reversion use one applicability
rule. A social post whose header deletes its auxiliary parent's content applies
ordinary projections only when it is an edit: it has an auxiliary parent and a
nonempty trimmed body. A blank or whitespace-only deleting post therefore adds
and removes no authored-time, reply, reaction, news, or self-mention
or reception-order projections. This rule is semantic rather than an arithmetic
guard: genuine counter or receipt-mapping mismatches still fail instead of
saturating or silently mutating unrelated state.

A below-limit `SOCIAL_POST` that has the delete-auxiliary-parent flag,
has an auxiliary parent, decodes successfully, and has `djot_content` whose
trimmed body is nonempty is an edit. It records exactly two immutable,
author-scoped replacement rows: a forward row that is both canonical source
metadata and a lookup index, and a reverse lookup row. Total migration
preserves the forward row and rebuilds the reverse row from it. Missing, empty,
or whitespace-only `djot_content` is a deletion, even
when other social-post fields are populated, and records no replacement
metadata. Replacement lookup follows edges transitively: in `E <- A <- B`,
resolving E yields newest B even when A's content became Deleted before A's
envelope or payload arrived.

Supplying hash-verified bytes for a Deleted event, or finding such bytes
already in the local deduplicated store when its envelope arrives, may only
establish that replacement metadata when the exact edit predicate above holds.
The database preserves the forward row across total migration and reconstructs
the reverse index from it; it does not retain newly supplied Deleted
bytes for replay. Deleted state continues to block content retrieval. The
database never schedules or requests bytes for a Deleted event.

This exception does not change content state, reference counts, fetch
scheduling, usage accounting, singleton or vote state, visibility indexes,
reply or reaction projections, news ranking, mentions, or notifications.
Over-limit, blank-body, malformed, non-social, and non-edit Deleted payloads
derive no metadata, and supplied bytes from these paths are not stored.

Deletion intent is monotone: once a valid direct deleting child has been
observed, ordinary child references and later lifecycle changes cannot erase
it. If several direct same-author children delete the same target, `deleted_by`
is the child with the maximum `(event.timestamp, ShortEventId)`. A deleting
child remains a candidate even when its own content is deleted. This attribution
is direct rather than transitive; in a chain where D2 deletes D1's content and
D1 deletes T's content, T is deleted by D1 and D1 is deleted by D2.
Attribution-only winner changes do not repeat reference-count, fetch-queue,
usage-accounting, or projection-reversion effects.

Per-identity payload usage counts every accepted event payload exactly once.
Total payload size and count equal the sums of the current, missing, deleted,
pruned, and invalid buckets. A payload whose envelope starts in Deleted enters
the total and deleted buckets directly; it never enters Missing, changes
content reference counts, or fabricates lifecycle transition side effects.
Counter overflow, underflow, and missing reference ownership abort the
transaction rather than silently clamping or manufacturing ownership.

Global current logical usage sums processed event lengths, counting shared
payloads once per event. Unique stored-byte usage counts actual hash-store values
once, including unreferenced bytes. Neither measure includes database overhead
or promises a bound on physical disk allocation.

## Local retention source metadata

Newly accepted headers retain an immutable pruning age origin: the minimum of
author time and first local header receipt. Successful first payload
materialization records a separate grace origin. Duplicate delivery, rejected
terminal-state content, and total replay never refresh either origin. These
origins are local source data, not reception-order projection timestamps.
Schema-27 cutover leaves older events without origins; neither replay nor late
payload delivery invents their missing history. Missing origins must fail closed
for quota eligibility. Wall-clock observations alone do not establish clock
reliability. The configured runtime trusts system time, including startup, without
a clock acknowledgement or monitoring subsystem.

Durable local quota decisions retain their reason and decision timestamp across
total migration. Replay applies them during the envelope pass before available
payloads can be materialized, including bytes surviving under another event's
reference. They remain Pruned, never Missing or Processed, unless a signed
deletion establishes the stronger Deleted state. The original quota decision
remains source metadata even then.

Explicit quota transitions support Processed eviction and Missing admission
rejection only for nonempty remote SocialPosts. They recheck the selected
lifecycle, local-author/kind protection, immutable origins and caller-asserted
clock trust inside the write transaction. Processed eviction requires expired
first-materialization grace. A Missing event has not started that grace, but
still needs a known, nonfuture header origin. Unknown historical origins and
unreliable clocks fail closed; stored observations cannot detect forward jumps.
A stale Missing selection cannot evict a concurrently materialized payload.

Quota pruning locally dematerializes applicable social-post visibility, reply
and reaction contributions, receipt, mention and news indexes without inventing
author deletion. Canonical replacement/deletion lineage and the materialization
feed remain intact. Lifecycle, original reason/time, reference and usage changes,
fetch removal and quota GC nomination commit together, with lossy invalidation
notifications only after commit. Accounting must be ready. The configured Enforce
runtime supplies pressure, explicit budgets and system-clock trust within the same
writer authority boundary. No restoration path is enabled.

Disposable candidate indexes contain only nonempty Processed remote SocialPosts
with known immutable origins after first-materialization grace. The complete
versioned retention policy and storing account `RostraId` identify one generation.
Changing either invalidates selection until bounded cleanup and backfill finish;
old and new policy keys cannot mix. Grace scheduling promotes bounded batches
without time-driven rescoring. Lifecycle changes update reverse ownership and
author/global indexes in the same transaction as accounting and projections.
Replay discards the generation rather than manufacturing historical origins.

Index readiness is independent of accounting and quota-nomination recovery.
Ordered selection is bounded by visited index rows, not only returned candidates,
and rechecks current lifecycle and immutable eligibility times. An untrusted clock
returns no candidates; a backwards clock cannot use a previously promoted row to
bypass grace or origin protection. The runtime does not detect clock jumps;
forward jumps may expire grace. Advisory selection does not authorize eviction:
active-generation, eligibility and pressure rechecks must compose with the checked
quota transition in one write transaction.

The configured Enforce driver composes those checks under writer and demand
cancellation arbitration, trusting the system clock including startup. General
author-first/global pressure counts logical reservations and preserves triggered
low-water targets across bounded turns. Fits and exact partially serviced demand
ownership prevent general pressure from spending acquisition-freed room twice.
Targets and candidate cursors are disposable, never authority to replay a quota
decision. Disabled remains the default; enabled modes require immutable,
explicit per-account startup configuration before acquisition or Client exposure.

In that driver, a ranked Missing rejection requires a fresh currently
eligible retained index head strictly above the incoming full rank, retained-only
pressure independent of reservations, and no Fits/exact partial-plan barrier or
live incoming reservation. Protected bytes count against caps but do not alone
prove a rank boundary. Skipped/future heads, unready state and transient pressure
remain Deferred. The checked Missing transition makes ordinary retries terminal,
including duplicate headers and shared-store reuse, without releasing retained
logical bytes. It is a current-policy decision, not a promise about future fit.

## Deduplication and retrieval

The shared admission boundary is Disabled by default; explicit Enforce startup
configuration installs admission and a caller-owned retention worker. It guards
materialization rather than only network downloads, so local publication,
direct verified-content callers and hash-store reuse cannot bypass logical
ceilings. Temporary admission deferral is not
Invalid, Pruned or a failed peer fetch. Admission-aware ingestion retains the
envelope and Missing schedule while deferring projections; legacy fallible
ingestion instead returns a structured capacity error and rolls back atomically.
Protected payloads count against the same ceilings; protection never grants
unbounded admission.

Logical reservations and actual acquisition buffers have different lifetimes.
Concurrent copies of one payload each consume buffer capacity, but reserve its
logical event charge only once. Committed materialization or terminal lifecycle
changes release the logical reservation. They do not release buffers still owned
by a network operation. Cancellation releases reservations through their owners;
transaction rollback cannot publish a terminal release. Client acquisition checks
terminal state and tries shared-store reuse before fetching. Each racing read and
its temporary Vec-to-Arc conversion has separate pre-allocation capacity; the
winning buffer remains owned through ingestion. Local serialization and raw signed
HTTP parsing consult provisional capacity before a verified envelope exists, then
bind the surviving allocation to its logical reservation. Explicit startup account
ownership is shared across preparse and lazy database load, with exclusive database
attachment. Reattachment invalidates old logical leases, not still-owned buffers.
Unloaded configured accounts have the same immutable preparse policy before
opening storage. HTTP retains its ordinary per-request body limit and loads
accounts only after validation; unverified paths create neither registry entries
nor databases. Disabled and DryRun do not enforce aggregate buffer capacity.
Enforce bounds declared
acquisition capacities, not whole-process memory or physical disk.

Content bytes are keyed by hash and may satisfy multiple events, but each
event's content-derived effects are processed independently. Reference counts
track how many events still want a hash, including Missing events. A zero count
alone does not authorize physical deletion. The bounded quota collector requires
a lifecycle nomination, complete accounting/replay-guard readiness, and a
transactional recheck of both actual RC and retained-header protection. Historical
local-authored or non-SocialPost references protect a colliding nominated hash
even after their event RC is released. These guards do not count as current
logical payload usage and cannot be released while the headers remain protected.
Canonical edit lineage is already durable independently of payload bytes.

Quota transitions nominate hashes atomically; general garbage from signed
deletion, invalidation and legacy size pruning is not collected. Physical
removal, unique-byte accounting and nomination consumption commit atomically.
Blocked nominations are consumed without removal, but separate quota-hash
provenance survives consumption. A later final reference release requeues only
hashes carrying that provenance, including when a signed deletion releases the
last shared reference. Reported reclaimed bytes measure unique values
actually removed, not logical releases.

Accounting upgrades and total replay start unready. Bounded resumable backfill
derives totals, expected RC and historical guards from retained sources, checks
RC and per-author current usage, and applies interleaved ingestion changes on
the already-scanned side of its cursors. Partial totals cannot authorize GC.
Accounting readiness does not establish policy candidate-index readiness.
Replay discards quota queue/provenance/cursor state. A separate bounded,
resumable scan of authoritative quota rows reconstructs it without admitting
general legacy garbage. Interleaved quota transitions nominate directly;
releases of scanned hashes requeue them and unscanned quota rows nominate when
visited. This recovery is independent of accounting readiness and starts no
worker.

Missing payloads are ordered by their next fetch time. New work is eligible
immediately and wakes the client fetcher after commit. Failed attempts update
attempt metadata and a later retry time; retry policy is chosen by the client,
while the database owns the schedule and state transition.
Temporary admission pressure instead postpones the observed schedule without
changing attempt count or last-attempt time. A strictly later compare-and-set
update lets other authors proceed and avoids deferred-front busy loops.

In canonical state, each event has at most one fetch-queue row. A current row
exists only for a Missing event, and its timestamp equals that state's
`next_fetch_attempt`. Legacy inconsistent physical rows can remain until they
reach the queue front, but queue APIs never return them as current work. A
failed fetch completion updates the schedule only when the schedule observed
by its caller is still current and the replacement schedule is strictly later;
a stale or non-forward completion has no effect. Strictly increasing schedules
prevent reuse of a timestamp as an ABA-prone compare-and-set token. Fetcher
queue peeking removes inconsistent front rows transactionally before returning
valid work, so stale rows cannot hide later work or cause content that reached
a terminal state to be fetched again. Total migration rebuilds the queue from
retained event and content sources rather than preserving old queue rows.

The crate's [content lifecycle guide](../docs/content-lifecycle.md) documents
the current tables, detailed flows, and test map. It must remain consistent
with this specification.
