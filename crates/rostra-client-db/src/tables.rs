//! Database table definitions for the Rostra client.
//!
//! For detailed documentation on content lifecycle, state transitions, and
//! edge cases, see `specs/SPEC-event-content-lifecycle.md` and
//! `docs/content-lifecycle.md` in this crate.
//!
//! # Data Model Overview
//!
//! The database stores a local view of the distributed event DAG that forms the
//! Rostra social network. All data in Rostra propagates as cryptographically
//! signed [`Event`]s, which form a DAG structure where each event references
//! parent events.
//!
//! ## Key Concepts
//!
//! - **Event**: A signed, immutable unit of data. Events form a DAG where each
//!   event references one or two parent events.
//! - **Event Content**: The payload of an event, stored separately for
//!   efficiency. Content can be pruned while keeping the event structure.
//! - **RostraId**: A user's public identity (derived from their Ed25519 public
//!   key).
//! - **ShortEventId**: A truncated event ID used for storage efficiency.
//! - **Singleton Events**: Events where only the latest instance matters (e.g.,
//!   profile updates).
//! - **Head Events**: Events with no known children - the current "tips" of the
//!   DAG for an identity.
//!
//! ## Content Storage Model
//!
//! Content is stored separately from event metadata for deduplication and
//! efficient pruning:
//!
//! - **[`content_store`]**: Stores actual content by [`ContentHash`] (blake3).
//!   Identical content is stored only once.
//! - **[`content_rc`]**: Reference count per content hash. Managed at event
//!   insertion time (not when content arrives).
//! - **[`events_content_state`]**: Tracks per-event content processing state.
//!   See "Content Lifecycle" below for details.
//! - **[`events_content_missing`]**: Events whose content bytes we want but
//!   don't have yet in [`content_store`].
//!
//! ### Content Lifecycle
//!
//! The key insight is that **event insertion** and **content processing** are
//! separate operations. An event can be inserted before we have its content,
//! and the same content can arrive multiple times (for different events).
//!
//! **Event Insertion** (via `insert_event_tx`):
//! 1. Event is added to [`events`] table
//! 2. RC is incremented in [`content_rc`] (for all non-deleted events,
//!    including `content_len == 0`)
//! 3. If `content_len > 0`: event is marked as
//!    [`Missing`](EventContentState::Missing) in [`events_content_state`], and
//!    if content bytes are not in [`content_store`], event is added to
//!    [`events_content_missing`]
//! 4. If `content_len == 0` and the event does not start Deleted: empty content
//!    is stored in [`content_store`] and the event goes straight to "processed"
//!    (no entry in [`events_content_state`])
//! 5. An event that starts Deleted skips RC and Missing while its payload is
//!    accounted directly in total and deleted usage
//!
//! **Ordinary Content Processing** (via `process_event_content_tx`):
//! 1. Check if event is `Missing` (if not, skip ordinary processing)
//! 2. Process content side effects (e.g., increment reply counts, update
//!    follows)
//! 3. Store content bytes in [`content_store`] if not already there
//! 4. Remove event from [`events_content_missing`] (if present)
//! 5. Remove `Missing` marker from [`events_content_state`]
//!
//! Verified Deleted social-post edits have one narrow exception: they may add
//! only immutable forward and reverse replacement rows. They do not
//! store supplied bytes or change lifecycle bookkeeping or other projections.
//!
//! **Content Deletion** (author requests content deletion):
//! 1. Event's content state changes to [`Deleted`](EventContentState::Deleted)
//!    in [`events_content_state`]
//! 2. RC is decremented in [`content_rc`] only if the prior state still
//!    contributed a reference; later deletion attribution updates do not
//!    decrement it again
//!
//! **Content Pruning** (local decision, e.g., content too large):
//! 1. Event's content state changes to [`Pruned`](EventContentState::Pruned) in
//!    [`events_content_state`]
//! 2. RC is decremented in [`content_rc`]
//!
//! **Garbage Collection**:
//! When RC reaches 0, content is eligible for removal from [`content_store`].
//! Removal is not currently automatic.
//!
//! ### Interpreting `events_content_state`
//!
//! - **No entry**: Content has been processed (including non-deleted events
//!   with `content_len == 0`)
//! - **`Missing`**: Event inserted but content not yet received/processed
//! - **`Invalid`**: Content failed validation (e.g. CBOR deserialization)
//! - **`Deleted`**: Content deleted by author
//! - **`Pruned`**: Content pruned locally
//!
//! ## Table Categories
//!
//! ### Identity Tables (`ids_*`)
//! Store information about identities (users) and their relationships.
//!
//! ### Event Tables (`events_*`)
//! Store the event DAG structure, content, and various indices.
//!
//! ### Social Tables (`social_*`)
//! Store derived social data extracted from events (profiles, posts, etc.).
