# Event Content Lifecycle

Schema 27 records immutable local retention origins and preserves quota-decision
source rows across total replay. These are independent of disposable receipt
indexes. Older events retain unknown origins; replay and duplicate delivery do
not invent or refresh them. Quota decisions constrain envelope replay before
shared content can materialize, with signed deletion remaining stronger.
Explicit checked quota transitions now dematerialize eligible remote
SocialPosts or decline Missing admission and nominate their hashes atomically.
No automatic victim selection, quota budgets or destructive worker is enabled.
Schema 28 adds checked accounting and a bounded quota-only collector; schema 29
adds disposable quota-hash provenance and bounded nomination reconstruction.
All databases require explicit accounting rebuild/readiness before totals or
collection are usable. See the
[database retention checkpoint](../../../docs/payload-retention-database.md)
and [SPEC-event-content-lifecycle](../specs/SPEC-event-content-lifecycle.md).

This document describes how events and their content are tracked, processed, and
reference-counted in the Rostra client database.

## Overview

Events in Rostra form a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Each event has an
"envelope" (metadata + signature) and "content" (payload). These are stored
separately to enable:

1. **Content deduplication**: Same content shared by multiple events is stored once
2. **Content pruning**: Large content can be discarded while keeping DAG structure
3. **Out-of-order delivery**: Events can arrive before their content

The public `Database::process_event_content` method also accepts the reverse
arrival order. `VerifiedEventContent` includes the verified envelope, so the
method inserts a missing envelope and processes the content atomically. Calling
`process_event` before or after it, or delivering either item repeatedly, does
not repeat reference counts, usage accounting, lifecycle transitions, or
content-derived projections. The lower-level `process_event_content_tx` helper
assumes an existing envelope and remains internal for transaction composition
and migration replay.

The shared admission foundation currently has no production activation path.
When exercised with configured limits, all legacy fallible content APIs return
`DbError::PayloadAdmissionPaused` on temporary refusal and roll back the entire
ingestion transaction; their panic wrappers also panic on that refusal.
`try_process_admitted_event_content` instead returns Deferred while preserving
ordinary header effects and Missing scheduling, separately from Processed,
Invalid and Unchanged. Temporary pressure is neither a peer failure nor a
quota-prune decision. See the [database retention guide](../../../docs/payload-retention-database.md)
for buffer ownership and the remaining client integration boundary.

Content may be empty (`content_len == 0`). Empty content is handled as normal
content — it gets an RC entry and is stored in `content_store` immediately at
event insertion time unless the event starts in Deleted.

New ingestion and total replay enforce the exclusive maximum described below.

## Total Replay

Opening a database older than schema version 25 performs one total rebuild
before reading derived rows. The preparation transaction stashes signed
envelopes, available immutable content, identity and initialization metadata,
event acquisition sources, and canonical forward replacement lineage. It
preserves caller-owned extension tables and discards every other built-in table.

Replay streams the stash twice in stable event-ID order. The envelope pass first
establishes the complete graph and final deletion, pruning, and missing state.
The content pass then processes available eligible payloads under current
reducers. This phase boundary prevents a deleted target from gaining a
projection merely because its payload replayed first; no parent-before-child
topology is required. Rebuilt receipts preserve source and membership, use
authored timestamps under a uniform policy, and receive new database-local
sequence values. Preparation intentionally discards available envelope receipt
timestamps; content-specific effective receipt times cannot generally be
reconstructed.

Retained records are trusted as previously authenticated ingestion output.
Replay retains typed decoding and payload commitment checks but does not repeat
Ed25519 authentication or claim to audit the database. Failure rolls back the
complete replay transaction and leaves the separately committed stash for the
next open.

Accounting and quota nominations are disposable across total replay. An explicit
bounded rebuild derives expected RC (including Missing), logical/unique totals
and historical shared-hash guards, validates RC and author usage, and publishes
readiness only on completion. Ordinary ingestion maintains cursor-covered
contributions transactionally during backfill. Existing replay may omit
unreferenced Deleted bytes; physical accounting describes the actual rebuilt
store. Canonical edit lineage survives independently of payload bytes.
Accounting readiness does not establish future policy-index readiness.
Quota-hash provenance and its recovery cursor are also disposable. A separate
bounded `rebuild_quota_payload_nominations` scan reconstructs provenance and
pending work from authoritative quota rows after replay or upgrade. It resumes
after reopen and safely interleaves with reference releases and new quota
decisions; its readiness is independent of accounting readiness.

Replay does not retain the event graph or per-event commit hooks. Application
and codec code transiently hold the current record, a decoded below-limit
payload, payload clones, and encoding scratch space; follow-history deletion uses
fixed 256-key batches. Work scales with event/reference B-tree operations and
total referenced payload bytes, not only unique content bytes. The final watch
refresh allocates proportional to self followees, followers, and two-hop WoT.

redb also retains dirty-page bookkeeping in process memory and copy-on-write
rollback pages for the whole atomic transaction. Total RAM and peak disk can
therefore scale with database size. There is no resource preflight or safe fixed
free-space multiplier. Measure a production-shaped copy, provision monitored RAM
and disk headroom, retain a restorable backup, and plan a long first open. Replay
does not compact the file.

Schema 26 adds an empty SocialPost materialization feed without backfill. Normal
ingestion appends after a successful ordinary projection in the same
transaction. Total replay suppresses new feed rows and preserves an existing
schema-26 feed byte-for-byte. A scan resolves each retained event identity
against current state, so later deletion, pruning, or replacement returns a
removed marker while leaving the occurrence and sequence intact.

The stacked version-24 schema changes and the version-25 rebuild must ship as one
deployable release. Never deploy an intermediate version-24 ancestor against
production storage. Once preparation commits version 25, rollback requires
restoring the pre-upgrade backup rather than running an older binary.

## State Machine

Each event's content processing goes through these states:

```
                                ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
                                │                                 │
                                v                                 │
Event Inserted ──► Missing ──► (no entry) ──► Deleted/Pruned     │
                      │               │              │            │
                      │               │              └────────────┘
                      │               │              (content delete after
                      │               │               prune/invalid changes
                      │               │               state, no RC change)
                      ├───────────────┴─► Deleted/Pruned
                      │  (content delete/     (if content deleted
                      │   prune before         before event arrives
                      │   content processing)  via events_missing)
                      │
                      └─► Invalid ──► Deleted
                        (content failed     (author content
                         validation)         delete records intent)
```

Note: Events with `content_len == 0` skip the `Missing` state entirely. They go
straight to "no entry" (processed) during event insertion unless they start in
Deleted.

### State Meanings

| State | `events_content_state` | Meaning |
|-------|------------------------|---------|
| Missing | `Missing { last_fetch_attempt, fetch_attempt_count, next_fetch_attempt }` | Event inserted, content not yet processed |
| Processed | *no entry* | Content processed, side effects applied |
| Invalid | `Invalid` | Content failed validation (e.g. CBOR deserialization) |
| Deleted | `Deleted { deleted_by }` | Author deleted this content |
| Pruned | `Pruned` | Locally pruned (too large, etc.) |

**Key insight**: "No entry" in `events_content_state` means content was
successfully processed. This is the normal state for most events.

## Reference Counting

RC tracks how many Processed and Missing events want a particular content hash.
Zero RC is necessary, but not sufficient, for quota garbage collection.

### RC Rules

1. **Increment**: When event is inserted (all events whose content is not
   already marked for deletion, including `content_len == 0`)
2. **Decrement**: When event content is deleted, pruned, or marked invalid
3. **Never double-decrement**: Guards check if content already Deleted/Pruned/Invalid

### RC and Content Store

- RC is managed at **event insertion time**, not when content arrives
- Content is stored in `content_store` when first processed (or immediately
  for `content_len == 0` events that do not start in Deleted)
- Zero RC alone does not nominate content or authorize removal. Only quota-nominated
  hashes with complete accounting readiness and no historical protected
  collision may be collected after transactional RC/guard rechecks.
- Retained local-authored and non-SocialPost headers guard a colliding nominated
  hash even after releasing RC. These guards are not current logical usage.
- Physical removal, exact unique-byte decrement and queue consumption commit
  atomically. Blocked nominations are consumed without removal; historical
  quota-hash provenance allows a later final reference release to requeue only
  quota-owned work. `prune_quota_payload` is the explicit checked nominator,
  not an automatic quota worker.

## Detailed Flows

### Flow 1: Normal Event Arrival (content_len > 0)

The configured maximum content length is an exclusive upper bound. Content
whose length is below the maximum follows this flow; content at or above it is
pruned during envelope processing and never enters Missing.

```
1. insert_event_tx:
   - Add event to `events`
   - Increment RC for content_hash
   - Mark as Missing { count: 0, next: ZERO } in `events_content_state`
   - Content already in store? Skip adding to `events_content_missing`
     (configured admission restores this event's current Missing schedule in
     `process_event_tx_with_source`, so shared-store reuse remains resumable)
   - Otherwise add (Timestamp::ZERO, event_id) to `events_content_missing`

2. process_event_content_tx:
   - Check length eligibility and can_insert_event_content_tx: Missing? → proceed
   - admit_materialization_tx: check ready accounting, author/global current
     bytes plus reservations, and a per-attempt buffer guard before side effects
   - Temporary refusal: legacy API rolls back; typed API retains header/Missing
   - Leave fetch scheduling unchanged if the payload is ineligible
   - Apply side effects (reply counts, follow updates, etc.)
   - Store content in `content_store` (if not already there)
   - Remove from `events_content_missing` (using next_fetch_attempt from state)
   - Remove Missing marker from `events_content_state`
```

### Flow 1b: Non-deleted Empty Content Event (content_len == 0)

```
1. insert_event_tx:
   - Add event to `events`
   - Increment RC for content_hash (blake3 hash of empty bytes)
   - Store empty content in `content_store` (if not already there)
   - Track payload as processed immediately (no Missing state)
   - No entry in `events_content_state` (already "processed")
```

### Flow 2: Event Arrives Before Content

```
1. insert_event_tx (event only):
   - Add event to `events`
   - Increment RC
   - Mark as Missing
   - Add to `events_content_missing` (content not in store)

2. Later, content arrives via another event:
   - Content stored in `content_store`

3. process_event_content_tx:
   - Check Missing → proceed
   - Apply side effects
   - Remove from `events_content_missing`
   - Remove Missing marker
```

### Flow 2b: Content Arrives at the Public Boundary Before the Envelope

```
1. process_event_content receives VerifiedEventContent:
   - Insert its carried verified envelope
   - Establish Missing, Deleted, or Pruned state using normal envelope rules
   - Process eligible content in the same transaction

2. The envelope later arrives separately:
   - Event insertion reports AlreadyPresent
   - RC, usage accounting, scheduling, and projections remain unchanged
```

This path is semantically the same as `process_event_with_content`. If the
carried envelope was already inserted, only eligible Missing content is
processed. Processed, Deleted, Pruned, and Invalid states retain their usual
idempotent behavior.

Latest-event projections apply one order while processing side effects:
follow/unfollow state, profiles, generic singletons, and individual votes keep
the maximum `(event.timestamp, ShortEventId)`. The vote aggregate changes only
when the same candidate wins the individual-vote comparison. Equal-second
events therefore converge independently of payload delivery order.

An individual-vote singleton retains its source event ID, full target, and
authoritative current-projection `Down`, `Neutral`, or `Up` value. Replacement
computes the aggregate delta from that inline old projection and updates every
affected aggregate and the winner in the same transaction. When two full
targets share the shortened event ID used as the singleton auxiliary key, a
winning replacement transfers the contribution between their aggregates and
vote reads return a value only for the retained full target. Reads and
replacement do not resolve the old source payload, so a source legitimately
removed after delete, prune, or garbage collection does not make the retained
projection unavailable.
Only singleton-shaped `SOCIAL_VOTE` events whose auxiliary key matches the
payload target enter this coupled winner/aggregate projection. A missing inline
projection or cached target outside its shortened row key is corruption and
fails closed.
Retained signed source remains authoritative for total replay and explicit
audits. A detected source/cache mismatch requires quarantine or recomputation
of the affected projection rather than changing only the cached winner value.

Active follows also retain the latest unfollow as an exclusive epoch boundary
and retain processed follow-event orders. `first_ts` is the timestamp of the
earliest follow strictly after that boundary, so late follow delivery can move
the current epoch's start earlier without allowing a pre-unfollow follow into a
later epoch. Follow/unfollow events in the same second use `ShortEventId` to
decide epoch membership. Notification cutoff remains timestamp-only: a social
post or shoutbox timestamp below both database initialization and `first_ts`
uses its authored time in the receipt index; one equal to `first_ts` uses local
receipt time.

### Flow 3: Content Deletion Before Target Event Arrives

Parent IDs resolve only within the deleting event's author graph, as specified
by [SPEC-event-graph](https://github.com/dpc/rostra/blob/master/crates/rostra-core/specs/SPEC-event-graph.md).
A present event by another author with the same short ID follows this
missing-target flow and cannot be mutated.

```
1. Delete event D arrives, same-author target T not in `events`:
   - T added to `events_missing` with deleted_by = D
   - An ordinary child referencing T preserves deleted_by = D
   - Another direct deleter is merged canonically; the maximum
     `(event.timestamp, ShortEventId)` becomes deleted_by

2. Same-author target event T finally arrives:
   - Check `events_missing`: found with deleted_by
   - Mark T's content as Deleted in `events_content_state`
   - Do NOT increment RC (content already marked for deletion)
   - Account T's payload directly in total and deleted usage without first
     entering Missing
   - Do NOT mark content as Missing
```

Deletion intent is monotone in both `events_missing` and
`events_content_state`. Multiple direct deleting children select the same
canonical `deleted_by` regardless of delivery order. Changing only the winner
does not repeat RC, queue, usage, or projection-reversion work.

Deletion affects content, not the signed header. In the direct chain
`T <-delete- D1 <-delete- D2`, D1's header keeps deleting T even after D1's own
content is deleted. The direct attributions remain `T.deleted_by = D1` and
`D1.deleted_by = D2`; D2 is not transitively assigned to T.

### Flow 4: Content Deletion After Target (While Content Missing)

```
1. Event T arrives in its author's graph:
   - RC = 1
   - T's content = Missing

2. Same-author delete event D arrives targeting T's content:
   - old_state = Missing
   - Set T's content = Deleted
   - Decrement RC (now 0)

3. Content for T arrives:
   - can_insert_event_content_tx: T's content = Deleted → return false
   - Ordinary content processing is skipped
   - A below-limit SOCIAL_POST with the delete-aux flag, an auxiliary
     parent, valid CBOR, and nonempty `djot_content.trim()` may record only its
     immutable forward and reverse replacement rows
```

The same limited replacement extraction applies when the deletion arrived
before the target envelope. In an edit chain `E <- A <- B`, delivery of B can
stage A as Deleted; later verified A content still records `E -> A`, so lookup
of E follows `E -> A -> B`. Blank deletion posts do not record an edit edge.
Missing, empty, or whitespace-only `djot_content` is blank regardless of other
social-post fields. The database also checks already-retained hash-keyed bytes
when a predeleted envelope arrives, but it never schedules or requests Deleted
content. Total replay preserves the immutable forward row and reconstructs the
reverse index without depending on zero-RC payload bytes; already-retained
bytes do not require an edit-lineage pin, but still require quota nomination,
readiness and RC/history checks before collection. Deleted content never becomes visible
or retrievable and does not update RC, queues, usage, time/reception indexes,
reply/reaction counts, news, mentions, votes, singletons, or notifications.

For an ordinarily processed SOCIAL_POST, insertion and later deletion
reversion use the same projection-applicability classification:

- a post without the delete-aux flag applies ordinary projections;
- a post with the delete-aux flag but no auxiliary parent applies no ordinary
  projections, even when its body is nonblank;
- a deleting post with an auxiliary parent and nonempty trimmed
  `djot_content` is an edit and applies ordinary projections;
- a deleting post with absent, empty, or whitespace-only `djot_content`
  applies no ordinary projections, even when reply, reaction, or news fields
  are populated.

The symmetric rule covers the authored-time, reply, reaction, news, and
self-mention projections, plus the effective-reception forward row and its
event-to-key reverse mapping. The receipt directions are inserted and removed
atomically. Reversion leaves the shared durable reception allocator advanced;
deleted sequence values are never reused. An absent reverse key is a no-op when
deletion ordering prevented ordinary projection insertion. A present reverse
key whose forward row is absent or names another event is an invariant failure
and rolls back deletion.
Reversion likewise does not compensate with saturating arithmetic: an eligible
projection with inconsistent counters remains an invariant failure. Immutable
replacement lineage follows its separate, Deleted-state exception above.

### Flow 5: Content Deduplication (Multiple Events, Same Hash)

```
1. Event A with hash H: RC(H) = 1, A's content = Missing
2. Event B with hash H: RC(H) = 2, B's content = Missing
3. Content arrives, process A: A side effects, A content processed
4. Process B (same content): B side effects, B content processed
5. Delete A's content: RC(H) = 1, content still available for B
6. Delete B's content: RC(H) = 0; bytes remain unless a separate authorized quota nomination and GC checks permit removal
```

### Flow 6: Invalid Content

```
1. Event T arrives:
   - RC = 1
   - T's content = Missing

2. Content arrives, process_event_content_tx:
   - Side effects processing fails (e.g. CBOR deserialization error)
   - Set T's content = Invalid in `events_content_state`
   - Decrement RC (now 0)
   - Content bytes NOT stored in `content_store`

3. If author later deletes T's content:
   - old_state = Invalid
   - Set T's content = Deleted (records deletion intent)
   - RC NOT decremented again (already decremented)
```

## Idempotency Guarantee

The `Missing` state ensures content processing is idempotent:

```rust
fn can_insert_event_content_tx(...) -> bool {
    match events_content_state.get(event_id) {
        Some(Missing) => true,       // Process it
        None => false,               // Already processed
        Some(Deleted|Pruned|Invalid) => false, // Unwanted/bad
    }
}
```

This prevents duplicate side effects when:
- Same event is delivered multiple times
- Same content is delivered multiple times for same event

## Edge Cases and Guards

### Double-Decrement Prevention

When deleting/pruning content, we check old_state:

```rust
if !matches!(old_state, Some(Deleted { .. } | Pruned | Invalid)) {
    decrement_rc(...);  // Only if not already decremented
}
```

### Content Delete After Prune/Invalid

- Event content pruned/marked invalid: state = Pruned/Invalid, RC decremented
- Content deletion event arrives: state changes to Deleted, RC NOT decremented again
- Semantic: Author's content deletion intent is recorded, but no double-decrement

### Prune After Content Delete/Invalid

- Event content deleted/marked invalid: state = Deleted/Invalid, RC decremented
- Prune attempted: returns false (content already deleted/invalid)

### Event Already Present

```rust
if events_table.get(&event_id)?.is_some() {
    return Ok(InsertEventOutcome::AlreadyPresent);
}
```

Duplicate event delivery is a no-op. RC not incremented again.

## Content Fetch Scheduling

Missing content is fetched by the `MissingEventContentFetcher` task using an
event-driven approach with exponential backoff.

### Table Structure

The `events_content_missing` table uses a composite key `(Timestamp,
ShortEventId)` where the `Timestamp` is the scheduled next fetch attempt time.
This makes the table naturally sorted by when content should next be fetched.

### Missing State Metadata

The `EventContentState::Missing` variant tracks fetch attempt metadata:

```rust
Missing {
    last_fetch_attempt: Option<Timestamp>,  // when we last tried (fact)
    fetch_attempt_count: u16,               // how many times we tried (fact)
    next_fetch_attempt: Timestamp,          // when to try next (scheduling)
}
```

The `next_fetch_attempt` field mirrors the `Timestamp` component of the current
`events_content_missing` key, enabling removal (which requires the full
composite key). In canonical state, each event has at most one queue row. A row
is current only when the event is `Missing` and its timestamp exactly equals
`next_fetch_attempt`; non-Missing events have no current queue row. A Missing
event whose bytes are already available locally can temporarily have no queue
row while local processing completes. Legacy inconsistent physical rows can
remain behind valid work until lazy front repair or total replay, but queue
APIs filter them from current work.

### Fetcher Loop

Instead of scanning the entire missing table on a fixed interval, the fetcher:

1. Transactionally deletes inconsistent front rows until it finds an exact
   state/schedule match
2. Peeks at that first valid entry (smallest key = earliest due)
3. If due now: attempts to fetch from peers
4. If not due: sleeps until the scheduled time
5. If no valid row remains: waits for a `Notify` signal

A `Notify` channel wakes the fetcher immediately when new missing content is
inserted (via `on_commit` hook in `process_event_tx`).

### Backoff Formula

On fetch failure, the next attempt is scheduled with exponential backoff:

```
backoff_secs = min(60 * 1.5^(attempt_count - 1), 86400)
```

- Initial backoff: 60 seconds (1 minute)
- Maximum backoff: 86400 seconds (24 hours)
- New entries start with `next_fetch_attempt = Timestamp::ZERO` (try immediately)

### Failed Fetch Recording

The `record_failed_content_fetch` DB method:

1. Reads the current `Missing` state and compares its schedule with the
   caller-observed schedule
2. Ignores the completion if the state is no longer Missing or its schedule has
   changed, or if `next_attempt_at` is not strictly later than the current
   schedule
3. Removes the schedule entry mirrored by the current state
4. Inserts one schedule entry with updated `next_attempt_at`
5. Updates `events_content_state` with incremented count and timestamps

The caller provides both `attempted_at` (fact) and `next_attempt_at`
(scheduling decision). The backoff calculation lives in the fetcher, not the
DB layer. This compare-and-set behavior makes overlapping fetch completions
safe: only the completion for the current schedule can advance retry metadata.
Strictly increasing schedules prevent a duplicate completion from succeeding
through reuse of the same schedule value.

Queue peeking repairs legacy or otherwise inconsistent front rows in the same
write transaction used to select work. It removes rows for non-Missing or
absent events and rows whose timestamp differs from `next_fetch_attempt`, then
continues to later work without returning an empty result. A total migration
discards old queue rows and derives the current queue from retained events and
content; there is no separate queue-repair migration.

Queue pagination omits inconsistent rows even when they remain behind a valid
front row awaiting lazy repair, so diagnostic/API consumers see only current
fetch work.

## Potential Concerns

### 1. No Automatic Garbage Collection

When RC reaches 0, content remains in `content_store`. The bounded quota
collector only handles hashes nominated by explicit checked quota transitions,
later final releases carrying quota provenance, or bounded reconstruction from
quota source rows. It starts no automatic worker and does not collect general
signed-deleted, invalid or legacy-pruned garbage. Row limits do not bound total bytes or database-file
allocation. See the [retention checkpoint](../../../docs/payload-retention-database.md)
for its accounting/readiness and replay boundary.

### 2. Missing Events / Missing RC

These abnormal internal conditions are rejected or diagnosed:

- **Calling `process_event_content_tx` for a non-existent event**:
  `debug_assert!` + `error!` log, then silently skipped in release mode. The
  public `process_event_content` boundary inserts the carried envelope first.
- **Decrementing RC with no RC entry**: returns an invariant error and aborts
  the transaction. RC and usage overflow/underflow fail rather than clamping or
  fabricating ownership.

The nonexistent-event condition panics in debug builds. Missing-RC decrement
fails transactionally in all builds; neither case authorizes fabricated
ownership or partial lifecycle bookkeeping.

## Test Coverage

### Admission Foundation Tests

`payload_admission_tests` covers production-disabled behavior, named explicit
limit validation, readiness and both logical ceilings, common/override author
caps, configured envelope scheduling of shared-store bytes, deferred reuse,
local/unknown protections without capacity exemptions, Invalid/temporary/terminal
outcome separation, independent acquisition/buffer count and byte limits,
duplicate reservations, racing writers and peer buffers, cancellation wakeups,
aborted materialization, foreign/stale guards and terminal late delivery.
Tests only activate disposable databases; no runtime pruning worker is exercised.

### Core Flow Tests

- `test_event_arrives_before_content` - Event before content flow
- `test_content_exists_when_event_arrives` - Content before event flow
- `public_content_ingestion_matches_combined_for_both_arrival_orders` - Public
  content-only, envelope-first, and combined ingestion converge across duplicate

### Property and Shuffled-Order Tests

The property interventions use the legacy pruning helper and simulated
test-only store removal. They cover per-author lifecycle usage, not schema-28
global/unique accounting, readiness/cursors, historical guards or the real quota
collector. `payload_accounting_tests` covers that separate local transactional
contract; `deleted_replacement_tests` exercises actual collection before
reopen/replay without losing canonical edit lineage.
`quota_pruning_tests` covers checked Processed/Missing transitions, quota
dematerialization, immutable feed/edit metadata, shared-reference ownership,
terminal races, rollback and bounded nomination recovery across replay/reopen.

- [`property-testing.md`](property-testing.md) documents the shared two-replica
  schedule runner, semantic models, exclusions, runtime budget, and soak command
- `prop_author_scoped_event_graph_converges` - Envelope graph indexes and
  unresolved canonical deletion attribution converge
- `prop_live_raw_content_lifecycle_converges` - Live RAW content bytes, RC,
  queue termination, and per-author lifecycle usage accounting converge
- `prop_terminal_content_lifecycle_converges` - Generated shared payloads,
  direct deletion, explicit pruning, simulated zero-RC byte collection, and
  usage buckets converge under one semantic oracle that ignores permitted
  physical residue
- `prop_replacement_projection_reversion_converges` - Deleting-post chains
  deterministically cover absent, empty, and whitespace bodies in both chain
  positions plus live and finally deleted edit chains, composing immutable
  replacement lineage with authored-time, reply, both public news orders,
  self-mention, receipt-membership, and visibility reversion
- `prop_follow_semantics_converge` - Follow winners, reverse membership,
  canonical epochs, and retained unfollow boundaries converge
- `prop_profile_and_singleton_semantics_converge` - Profile fields and
  profile/generic singleton winners converge
- `prop_vote_semantics_converge` - Per-voter shortened-key winners, full-target
  reads, and normalized numerical aggregates converge, including target-author
  collisions
- `test_shuffled_singleton_events_converge` - Shuffled finite latest-event sets
  select the total-order maximum

## Summary

The content lifecycle model handles:

- Out-of-order delivery (event before content, content delete before target)
- Duplicate delivery (idempotent via Missing state)
- Content deduplication (RC tracks multiple events per hash)
- Empty content (processed immediately at insertion unless already Deleted)
- Invalid content (failed validation, RC decremented, bytes discarded)
- Content deletion and pruning (with double-decrement prevention)
- Checked counters, global logical/unique-byte accounting, explicit checked quota
  transitions and a quota-only collector, with separate bounded accounting and
  nomination-recovery readiness and no automatic worker
- Fetch scheduling (exponential backoff for missing content, event-driven wake-up)

The `Missing` state is the key to idempotency - it ensures content side
effects are applied exactly once per event, regardless of how many times the
content is delivered.
